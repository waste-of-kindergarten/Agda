This is a blog with notes in Chinese when learning plfa myself. To read the notes, please click https://waste-of-kindergarten.github.io/Agda/PLFA/ and find out.

All notes are rendered with newsprint style with highlighted agda codes. Readers may also click the agda codes to check the definitions.

Even though answers for the exercises are provided, please think twice before using it. Think about why you learn this.
